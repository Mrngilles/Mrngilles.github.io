To be able to develop any Twitter account, you will probably need
external tools, unless you are an omniscient being, which I tend to
believe ;-).

There are a lot of them out there, and you need to pay for almost all
of them. So when you start leveraging Twitter for your company, that
can be a bit repulsive.

After searching for a veeeery long time (a whole day)... OK, just for
a little while, I came up with 9 tools that seem really interesting.
Remember that I just started using Twitter, so you can believe me
1000% when I say those are the best.

1. For **analytics**, I found [Audiense](https://www.audiense.com/). You can
get your new followers, number of unfollows, language, countries,
gender, Best time to tweet, and much more. And this is only the free
part !!!

2. If you want to **follow hashtag discussions** , you can use a *chat*
application, such as [Twubs](http://twubs.com/). It is really easy to
use, really intuitive. You just type which *hashtag* you want to chat
on, and *voila*, you're in.

3. To **manage your followers** and *unfollow* inactive people, use
[Crowdfire](). As long as you don't follow more than 25 new people
and unfollow 100 per 24 hours, you won't need to upgrade to the paid
version. You will also get recent (un)followers on the dashboard directly.

4. To easily **add an image** to a *Tweet* in which you put a link, share
using [Twitshot](http://www.twitshot.com/). It will let you choose a
picture from the ones present on the page your link points to, and
directly add it to your tweet.

5. To **easily choose your hashtags**, you should be using
[Ritetag](https://ritetag.com/dashboard/). You will get a fast
overview of the *"hotness"* of a hashtag, or see quickly if it is
reaaaaaally bad.

6. To get daily, **automatic monitoring** of hashtags, users, and anything
you can think of on Twitter, use [Warble](https://warble.co/). There,
you can setup alerts for about anything happening within the birdy
application.

7. If you plan to **schedule tweets** to be send at certain precise
times, use [Buffer](https://buffer.com). The other magic of this app,
is that the tweets sent through it are automatically tracked, and you
get precise feedback on what worked and what did not. Neat to follow
your progress !

8. For a **better overview** of your twitter account, use
[Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/). On this, you can see in a
glance what happened on your profile, your notifications, your DM and
the activities of your network. I just started using it and I already
feel at home. I hope you will too !

9. Finally, to **remember to follow-up** on conversations, get a handle
on [Nudge](http://getnudge.co/). It will send you reminders on a
regular basis to follow-up on a previous discussion.

I will be back tomorrow with a new post. I plan to look into expanding
my network by connecting with *influencers*. First thing will be to list
5 influencers, then connect with them, by asking a question. I will
find 5 new people from the field I plan to work into (first ruby
developers, then python developers, then expand to the developers
field in general) everyday from this point on, in order to expand,
so that I can end up helping as much people as possible.

Live to learn !
