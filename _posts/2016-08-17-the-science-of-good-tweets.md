One of the main objectives you usually have on Twitter, is to grow
your followers base. If you start from scratch, and know nothing about
it, you'll have a hard time going through all the articles, finding
the best solutions, trying everything.

And that's what you can see (*read*) me doing here... Having a hard
time...

Today, is about getting out great tweets (I should probably read on
writing great blog posts, but that'll be for later).

So what does it take for a tweet to be good ?

Well, if you're like me, and have around 50 followers, you won't
really see the difference. That doesn't mean you can neglect your
audience. Quite the opposite !

Give the few followers you have amazing quality content !

Let me explain...

While you're so small, like me, you obviously should be experimenting.
However, it will probably lead you nowhere, as you have no way to
measure how your audience responds.

My advice would be that for now, you stick to the basics. Let's remind
some of those base principles. All of them are thouroughly explained in the
[buffer blog article](https://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-writing-great-headlines-on-twitter-facebook-and-your-blog)
written by [Leo Widrich](https://twitter.com/LeoWid).

1. Use action words: more verbs, fewer nouns
2. Use retweetable words
3. Use self-explanatory pictures (this is a tip for fb posts, but
   would probably be applicable on Twitter too)
4. Links to lists, like *"5 best ways to ..."*
5. Links to tutorial (*How-to, Introduction, Beginners' guide...*)
6. Use words that make posts more viral

There are probably other resources I missed, but this one was fairly
relevant, and caught my attention, so here you go!

With this knowledge, go tweet my little birds

Tomorrow will be about relationships with some of your core audience
member, in order to help them grow, and get caught in the wave.

Live to learn !
