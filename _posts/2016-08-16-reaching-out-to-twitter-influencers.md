## Influencers

After a little trip (6 hours drinving), I finally sat up to develop my
Twitter *skills* for today. As told in the previous [post]({% post_url
2016-08-15-my-9-favourite-free-twitter-tools %}), I mainly focused on
reaching out to influencers, in the domain of startup buidling, social
media marketing, personal development and others... (*How is this guy
ever going to be able to succeed if he does not focus more than
this???*)

I tried and reach, but noticed that the top people are usually too
busy, and probably have so much people talking to them that they
either won't respond, or have no time to develop a relationship.

If you want to get to them, you will have to expand your network.

To do so, the best way is to get in touch with "micro-influencers".
Those are the people that have a consequent followers pool, but are
still "newbie-accessible" (that is, if you're like me, a newbie, and
have under 10k followers, I guess).

Building a relationship with those people will not only help you grow
your followers pool, but give you a better understaning of your
industry.

To reach out to those people, I'll look up on my Feed, and reach out
to the people that seem to have the most interesting content. This
includes the 1 followers people (never know what anyone can bring you,
right?).

I'll either send a tweet, or RT some of their content, or like
something. If I have intereting content that could suit them
particularly, I can tweet it to them directly.

I'll start by building relationships with 5 micro-influencers, then
expand as I see fit.

## Reading

I also read some more articles, which were really
interesting on developing your network.

1. [How Working With Micro-Influencers Can 10X Your Sales!](https://shanebarker.com/blog/micro-influencers/)
   This explains how it is easier to reach out to people with smaller
   following base, as they are more likely to interact with you, thus
   exposing you to their followers
2. [How to Rapidly Grow Your Twitter Following](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/how-rapidly-grow-your-twitter-following)
   Loved the guest post tips, the other tips being quite well known.

Day 3 on 7 on the Twitter learning. Of course, a single week is not
enough to learn all there is to know about Twitter. However, it will
give me a good starting point, and momentum to keep growing.

Tomorrow will be about writing good tweets, so come back to see the
evolution, and I hope you get some good tips !

Live to learn !
