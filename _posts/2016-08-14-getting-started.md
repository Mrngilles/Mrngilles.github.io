This is not a blog !

This is a way for you to follow my learnings.

A way for you to learn beside me.

I tried starting a blog before, a few times. And on each attempt, I
never went further than a few posts, that no one ever read (except
me).

Of course I would give up after 3 posts! I started for selfish
reasons, that even I did not fully understand. So I started looking
around for ways to develop, ways to expand, ways to contribute, ways
to help. I started reading (and still do) everything I could get my
hands on, started listening to podcast about successful people,
started watching interviews of the people most fulfilled in their
lives. Pieces started to fall together, connexions created in my
brain.

And today, after getting into Twitter
([@mrngilles](https://twitter.com/mrngilles)), I found an amazing
[video](https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/764307770560614400) by
Gary Vaynerchuk ([@garyvee](https://twitter.com/garyvee)). In this, he
explains that you cannot always be creative, and that a way to still
create content everyday, is to document everything you're doing.

So this is my documenting, in which I will be as precise as possible,
on my victories, the obstacles I encounter, the ways I go, the
materials I learn. All of this for you, to be able to see and
understand my path to success.

So let's get started with what I learned today !

# Twitter networking

In order to network the proper way, the first action I have to take is
to define exaclty what I want from this networking. For now, my goal
is to learn about the inner workings of Twitter, and get to 100
followers. This goal will evolve with time, but I start by setting a
small goal (Actually, my first goal was 10 people, but I already
achieved it, so yay!).

My objective on a longer term will be to associate with my website
(under development) to help more people learn and grow. Thus, I will
have to get people from the field I want to work in (developers, new
and experienced) to follow me. More about my project in a few weeks!

In order to achieve this goal, I will:

- Tweet at least 5 times a day, on my progress
- Find 5 new people to follow every day
- Send a private message to every new follower
- Read the last 10 tweet of every follower in order to understand what
  they are tweeting about, who they are
- Put at least 2 keywords per tweet
- Look at lists once a day
- Retweet the relevant content I get
- Cite other in 1 tweet
- Ask 1 useful question to someone everyday
- Read about Twitter networking for the next 7 days for 30 minutes

I hope to be able to connect with everyone of you !

Live to learn !
